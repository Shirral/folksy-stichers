# Folksy Stitchers

![Responsive Mockup](assets/readme/mockup.jpg)

**Folksy Stitchers** is a website created for a fictional embroidery club meeting up regularly to practice their craft, learn new techniques, make friends, and have a great time while creating something beautiful together with others in a relaxed, informal atmosphere.

The website caters both to existing members, who might wish to join the club's Facebook group or share their ideas for the upcoming meetings, and to new members, who might want to know what meetings are available, where or when they take place, or who might have questions. It also responds to the needs of the uncertain who might wonder whether they want to give it a try, but have some concerns - such as, "I've never done it before, I don't know where to start", or, "do I need to bring anything?".
